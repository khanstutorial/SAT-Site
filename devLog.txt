  (index.html, templates/halloffame.html, templates/mentorship.html, templates/programs.html, templates/satfaqs.html)
  The way the template pages are stored make it impossible for them to link properly
  This can be solved:
    - If the template pages are never referenced, only used as templates
    - If the links in the template pages are fixed, and the corresponding lookup substrings in replicator2000.py are fixed

  (index.html, nukeShelter/index.html, nuke.sh)
  Whenever nuke.sh is called, all html files in the main directory and generated by replicator2000 are deleted
  index.html is copied back into the main directory from the nukeShelter
    - any changes to index.html must be made inside the nukeShelter, only files inside the nukeShelter and inside templates survive
